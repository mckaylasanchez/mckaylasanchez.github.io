Initial Project Setup: 
Step 1: Unzip the file in a place on your computer where you can easily access the project. There is no need to update the SanchezPizzeria database, run the build script, or reload the view.

Process for Forms: 
Step 1: Open the Sanchez Pizzeria Forms 

Step 2: The SanchezPizzeria Startup form is already set as the startup form so once visual studio has loaded and opened, run this form first by clicking the Start button. 

Step 3: Click the Search Order button to open the Search Order form. 

Step 4: You can leave all defaults and get one result for the customer, Amy Johnson, or you can press the List All Orders button where the Total Spent will then display $1434.50 and Total Quantity should be 78.

Step 5: If you try to enter a new phone number or random string of numbers an error message will occur saying that there are no listings found. Next, press the X in the upper right corner to close the form and return back to the Startup form.

Step 6: Now click the Employee button to take you to the Employee Information form.

Step 7: You can toggle through the various employees by using the blue arrow keys or search by employee last name in the box at the top. Trveor Jackson will be the first employee displayed with all of his corresponding information. 

Step 8: Click browse to be taken to a folder of employee photos where you can choose one and then upload the photo for Trevor Jackson. 

Step 9: Press the X in the upper right corner to close the form and return back to the Startup form.

Step 10: Click the Restaurant button to open the Restaurant Information form. You can use the restaurant location dropdown to find results for each city. 

Step 11: Choose Boulder to see that there has been a total of 9 orders made up of 5 reservations, 4 walk-ins, 3 cash payments, and 6 card payments. 

Step 12: Press the X in the upper right corner to close the form and return back to the Startup form.

Step 13: Finally, click the customer button open the Customer Information form. On this form search for a specific customer by last name at the top text box. 

Step 14: Enter the last name "Lee" into the box and click search to see the customer information for Dana Lee. 

Step 15: Press the X in the upper right corner to close the form and return back to the Startup form.

Step 16: Use the close button on the Startup form to get out of the Startup form and double-click the Employees and Orders report under the Solution Explorer. 

Step 17: Open the report in preview mode. Expand on an employee to see more information. You can see by the highlighting which of the employees are part-time servers and which have another job classification or work full-time. 

Step 18: Go back to design mode before double-clicking the Orders by Customer and Location Report in the Solution Explorer. 

Step 19: Go into preview mode for this report and choose any one of the restaurant locations for the parameter and then click the View Report button. You can now expand on a customer to see more information like which server helped them and how much their order total was on each of their visits into the restaurant. 

Step 20: Go back into design mode. Thank you for exploring my Phase 3 project and learning more about Sanchez Pizzeria!
